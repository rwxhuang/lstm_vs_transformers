# Predicting the Future: LSTM vs Transformers for Time Series Modeling
A comparison analysis between LSTM and Transformer models in the context of time-series forecasting. While LSTMs have long been a cornerstone, the advent of Transformers has sparked significant interest due to their attention mechanisms. In this study, we pinpoint which particular features of time series datasets could lead transformer-based models to outperform LSTM models.
